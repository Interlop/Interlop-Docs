## How do I invite Zinterlop Bot Bot to my server?

You will need **`Manage Server`** or **`Administrator`** permissions to the bot. Use this [Discord Oauth URL](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=917913235255099432&permissions=-30020514&scope=bot+applications.commands+identify+guilds) to invite the bot.

## What is the default prefix and how can I change it?

The default prefix is `!`. At the moment, there is no ability to change the default prefix.

## Why is Zinterlop Bot offline?

The bot may be offline due to the machine either being offline/shutdown or the bot had an error and went offline without any command.
